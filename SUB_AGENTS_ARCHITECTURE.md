# Sub-Agents Architecture for App Development

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive sub-agent architecture for building full-stack applications. Each sub-agent is specialized for specific domains and can be invoked automatically based on context or explicitly called when needed.

## Architecture Principles

### Model Assignment Strategy
- **Haiku (Fast/Low Cost)**: Simple tasks, code formatting, basic documentation
- **Sonnet (Balanced)**: Development tasks, code review, testing, architecture decisions  
- **Opus (Advanced)**: Critical tasks, security auditing, complex system design, AI/ML work

### Delegation System
- **Auto-delegation**: Context-aware routing based on task analysis
- **Explicit calling**: Direct agent invocation using `@agent-name` syntax
- **Multi-agent workflows**: Coordinated tasks across multiple specialists

## Best Practices

### Agent Selection Guidelines
1. **Match complexity to capability**: Use appropriate model tier
2. **Leverage specialization**: Choose domain-specific agents
3. **Consider workflow position**: Select agents based on development phase
4. **Enable collaboration**: Use agents that work well together

### Performance Optimization
1. **Batch related tasks**: Group similar work for single agent
2. **Minimize context switching**: Keep agent focus consistent
3. **Use caching**: Leverage agent memory for repetitive tasks
4. **Monitor usage**: Track agent effectiveness and costs

### Quality Assurance
1. **Always include review**: Use `code-reviewer` for all implementations
2. **Security by default**: Involve `security-auditor` for sensitive features
3. **Test coverage**: Engage `test-engineer` for comprehensive testing
4. **Documentation**: Ensure agents document their decisions and code

## Conclusion

This sub-agent architecture provides a comprehensive framework for building robust, scalable applications with specialized expertise at every level. By leveraging the right combination of agents and models, development teams can achieve higher quality, faster delivery, and better maintainability.

The modular nature allows for easy customization and extension based on specific project needs, while the collaboration patterns ensure smooth workflow coordination across the entire development lifecycle.
